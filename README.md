# flutter_do

My very own To-Do app built with Flutter and Firebase.  Borrows
heavily from an app built while taking [this udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/flutter-dart-the-complete-flutter-app-development-course/learn/v4/content).
Also pulled in some tips from [here](https://flutter.institute/firebase-signin/).

## Getting Started

For help getting started with Flutter, view this online
[documentation](https://flutter.io/).
